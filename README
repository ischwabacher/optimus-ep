h1. Optimus

h5. Turning data into results

Optimus is a set of libraries designed to process behavioral data for use in statistical analysis packages. Think of it as the ultimate scriptable spreadsheet.

Currently, it's geared towards processing files generated by "E-Prime":http://www.pstnet.com/eprime.cfm, but really works with anything that produces spreadsheet-like data.

h2. Installing

We're all set in "RubyGems":http://rubygems.org, so: 

<pre>
sudo gem install optimus-ep
</pre>

should get you set up with Optimus and the required "RParsec":http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JPARSEC/rparsec+overview. I've developed and tested with Ruby 1.8.7, but suspect 1.9.x will work, too.

h2. Command-line tools:

Right now, there's one program recommended for general use:

h3. eprime2tabfile

Turns the text file written by E-Prime (or, really, any file we can read) into a tab-delimited file. It prints to stdout, and should be redirected if you want to save the output.

Usage:

<pre>
Usage: eprime2tabfile [options] INPUT_FILES

    -o, --outfile=OUTFILE            The name of the file to create. If this
                                     isn't specified, print to the standard
                                     output.

    -c, --columns=COLUMN_FILE        A tab-separated file containing the columns
                                     in the order you want your output.

        --filter-columns             Write out only the columns in COLUMN_FILE.
                                     Requires the use of --columns

    -a, --add-filename-line          Print the filename as the first line of
                                     your output, just like E-DataAid.

    -f, --force                      Continue processing even there are errors.

    -h, --help                       Print this message.
</pre>
