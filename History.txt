== 0.6.9 2/25/2008
* New features:
  * Supports parsing raw tab-delmimted files
  * Allows Procs as starting values for ComputedColumns
* Bug fixes:
  * No longer jumbles the order of Eprime log files

== 0.6.5 9/2/2008
* New features:
  * Speed! Speed! Speed! Should be something like 10x faster.
  * Procs are now allowed in ComputedColumns -- so if you want to do really
    arbitrary things in your column computation, have at it.

== 0.6.0 7/14/2008
* New features:
  * Added extract_timings, a script to pull stimulus timing data from eprime
    files.
  * Added a GenericRunner -- a class that greatly eases end-to-end
    transformation of eprime data. See extract_timings for an example of
    its use.

== 0.5.5 7/09/2008
* New features:
  * Supports making multiple passes through data, to allow extracting multiple
    stimuli that occur on the same row
  * Created a general-purpose stimulus extractor to pull data out in the
    format:
    stimulus \t onset__time \t offset__time
* Architectural changes:
  * Created a BasicTransformer that performs all of the basic operations to
    datasets: column calculation, row filtering, and multipass
  * Moved ColumnCalculator, RowFilter, and Multipasser into a Transformers
    module
  * Support release via hoe / rubygems

== 0.5.0 6/26/2008

* First public gem release
  * Supports converting general Eprime files into tab-delimited files
  * Supports converting Eprime files into AFNI stim_times files
