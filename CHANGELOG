v0.8.1. Remove --filter-columns option from eprime2tabfile

v0.8.0. Compatibility Warning: Lots of stuff has changed with the way column definition strings are computed. Test your existing scripts after updating! Architecture changes: Completely rewrote parser. String-based expressions now deprecate lambdas, though they'll continue to work in the future. This change fixes lots of odd bugs in defining computed columns and filters. Bug fixes: The --columns and --filter-columns options for eprime2tabfile now work.

v0.6.9.1. Bug fix: Fix for parsing eprime log files in which leaf frames don't occur at the highest log level

v0.6.9. New features: Supports parsing raw tab-delmimted files; Allows Procs as starting values for ComputedColumns. Bug fixes: No longer jumbles the order of Eprime log files

v0.6.5. New features: Speed! Speed! Speed! Should be something like 10x faster. Procs are now allowed in ComputedColumns -- so if you want to do really arbitrary things in your column computation, have at it.

v0.6.0. New features: Added extract_timings, a script to pull stimulus timing data from eprime files; Added a GenericRunner -- a class that greatly eases end-to-end transformation of eprime data. See extract_timings for an example of its use.

v0.5.5. New features: Supports making multiple passes through data, to allow extracting multiple stimuli that occur on the same row; Created a general-purpose stimulus extractor to pull data out in the format: stimulus \t onset__time \t offset__time. Architectural changes: Created a BasicTransformer that performs all of the basic operations to datasets: column calculation, row filtering, and multipass; Moved ColumnCalculator, RowFilter, and Multipasser into a Transformers module; Support release via hoe / rubygems

v0.5. First public gem release; Supports converting general Eprime files into tab-delimited files; Supports converting Eprime files into AFNI stim_times files
